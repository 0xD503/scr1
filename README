SCR1 Quick Start Guide:

1. Clone and build the RISC-V toolchain

git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
git checkout 4bcd4f57af50b32efafa2088f996ede3142ec77b
./configure --prefix=<YOUR_INSTALL_PATH> --with-xlen=32 --with-arch=IM
make

Add the <YOUR_INSTALL_PATH>/bin folder to the PATH environment variable


2. Build RTL, compile and run RISC-V ISA tests

Folders:
docs                SCR1 documentation
riscv_isa_tests     subset of the RISC-V ISA tests from the master risc-v repo, relevant for SCR1
src                 SCR1 RTL source and testbench files

- "make" with no parameters called from a repository root will build RISC-V ISA tests, and run Modelsim simulation with default parameters
- "make run_vcs" will run VCS simulation with default parameters
Please note that VCS or Modelsim executables should be in your PATH variable

After all the tests have finished, the results can be found in build/test_results.txt (default location)

- Test build and run parameters can be configured in the Makefile
- SCR1 core parameters can be configured in src/includes/scr1_arch_description.svh

Make sure that architectural config selected for the SCR1 RTL matches the one used for tests compilation
